To remove a feature from calculator permanently change 'calc_features.h' file.

For example if you want to get rid of colors/fonts from the calculator
permanently then remove or comment out '#define CALC_COLORS' from
'calc_features.h' header file and compile the program[See INSTALL for
compilation].

Remove or comment out the line having '# define SCREEN_MANIP' in the file
calc_features.hpp if you are not a developer or rigorous user of this program
as it has a buggy behaviour(not so anoying) while passing a SIGWINCH signal.
It is still in usable state but some more features will be improved in near
future.
