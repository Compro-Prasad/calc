ABOUT
	Initially this calculator was just made by me when I studied in class
	XI and it had support for only binary operations. Till then I had no
	idea of Open Source softwares. And I also didn't know much of
	programming techniques. So I stopped working on it and started shifting
	onto other smaller projects.
	But then I visualised what all problems were faced while longer
	calulations. I figured out that when normal users faced bigger
	calculations they had to remember the previous answers before
	proceeding forwards and they also had to sacrifice the amount of
	precision recieved in their previous answer. So I started writing code
	for storing answers in the memory so they could be retreived afterward
	thus relieving stress off the user's head. But till then I had learned
	about stacks, postfix and infix notations thus the user could also
	enjoy writing larger expressions upto 5000 characters. Then the
	operator support also widened to a great extent supporting bitwise
	operations also.
	Now it has abilties for normal file operations, color changing, and
	history support.
