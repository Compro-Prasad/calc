1) Use of long double gives wrong precision in longer precisions and wrong
   integers in longer integers.
2) SCREEN_MANIP is still under development so its better to avoid its use.
3) Some bugs may have poped up due to sudden change of all 'long int' datatypes
   to 'unsigned long' datatypes.

Solution:
1) Use 'show e' command to view values in exponentials by setting maximum
   precision to 15[using command 'precision 15']. This will throw out the wrong
   values and thus you will get a precise answer which is always better than a
   wrong answer.
2) Remove/comment out the line "# define SCREEN_MANIP" and then compile.
3) No solution is there untill now as no rigorous testing has been done. This
   line will be removed after testing properly.
