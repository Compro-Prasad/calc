1)Use of long double gives wrong precision in longer precisions and wrong
  integers in longer integers.
2)Using long expressions/commands in input without providing any space
  crashes the program due to overflow.

Solution:
1)Use 'show e' command to view values in exponentials by setting maximum
  precision to 5[using command 'precision 5']. This will throw out the wrong
  values and thus you will get a precise answer which is always better than a
  wrong answer.
2)Provide a small expression/command before providing first space to be on
  the safe side. Then you are free to provide any long command/expression.
