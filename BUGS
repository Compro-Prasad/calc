Use of long double gives wrong precision in longer precisions and wrong
integers in longer integers.

Solution:
Use 'show e' command to view values in exponentials by setting maximum
precision to 5[using command 'precision 5']. This will throw out the wrong
values and thus you will get a precise answer which is always better than a
wrong answer.
