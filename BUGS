1) Use of long double gives wrong precision in longer precisions and wrong
   integers in longer integers.

Solution:
1) Use 'show e' command to view values in exponentials by setting maximum
   precision to 15[using command 'precision 15']. This will throw out the wrong
   values and thus you will get a precise answer which is always better than a
   wrong answer.
