1)Using strings to store numbers in place of long doubles using n number of
  precision after decimal and get more accurate values. This will be just like
  the 'scale' variable in 'bc'.
2)Using the ncurses API in a stripped version to integrate it with the
  calculator which will allow to run in absence of ncurses library.
3)Making the 'configure' file.
4)Making it more portable.
5)Implementing calculator's native variables and functions.
